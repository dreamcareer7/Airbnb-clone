# Welcome to Aerbnb
Aerbnb is a single-page, full stack web application inspired by Airbnb. It utilizes Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database on the back-end, and React.js and Redux on the front-end. Users can view, book, and search for listings by location.

## Key Features
### Heirbnb Design Documents

### User Authentication
* Users can sign up or log in to use the application.
* Users can also log in through a demo account.
### Listings
* Listings are displayed on the homepage.
* Users are able to search for listings via Google Maps Places API.
### Bookings
* A logged in user is able to view his or her bookings.
* A logged in user is able to make valid bookings on listings and delete any booking he or she made.
### Technology Stack
Aerbnb is a single-page web application with one backend route responsible for rendering HTML. User interactions in the front-end side trigger AJAX requests to the back-end, which is responsible for rendering database information in JSON format.

## Front-end
### React
The response information is taken by the React JS library to update the page.

* One of the ways React is a useful tool for front-end development is creating a virtual DOM to make DOM manipulation efficient.
### Redux
Redux manages the front-end state of Heirbnb. When database information is retrieved, Redux state is updated first and re-renders the appropriate React components.

## Back-end
### Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is the back-end framework used to query the database. Read more

### Database
Aerbnb uses a PostgreSQL database to store its relational data.

### Future Plans
* Implement ability for users to upload profile pictures and edit profile page
* Infinite scrolling or pagination on the index pages
* Implement ability to interact with friends, i.e. messaging
* Additional filters for listings
